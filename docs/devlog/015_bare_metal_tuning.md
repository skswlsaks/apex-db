## Summary

This devlog records the iterative bare-metal performance tuning of APEX-DB using an AI-driven tuner (`scripts/ai_tune_bare_metal.py`) powered by Claude Opus 4.6 with extended thinking, combined with manual profiling and compiler optimization experiments.

**Final Results vs. Original Baseline:**

| Benchmark | Original | Final (LTO+PGO+tcmalloc+hugepages+single-col opt) | Delta |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Xbar 1M rows | 45.2ms | **12.41ms** | **-73%** |
| EMA 1M rows | 2.15ms | 2.23ms | +4% |
| Window JOIN 100K×100K | ~12ms* | 11.58ms | ~flat |

*Window JOIN baseline appeared as 10.07ms in the first dry-run, but consistent measurement shows ~12ms is the true value at current system load.

## Methodology

### AI Tuner (`scripts/ai_tune_bare_metal.py`)

The tuner uses `claude-opus-4-6` (via AWS Bedrock) with extended thinking (`budget_tokens=8000`) to:
1. Profile the system (CPU governor, hugepages, THP, C-states, NUMA, sysctl)
2. Run APEX-DB benchmarks and parse results
3. Ask Claude to analyze and produce prioritized tuning commands (JSON)
4. Apply commands, re-benchmark, and iterate

Claude's extended thinking correctly identified each bottleneck in priority order.

---

## Tuning Iterations

### Iteration 0: Dry-Run Baseline

System state before any tuning:
- Hugepages: **0 allocated** (all arena mmap calls failed with `MAP_HUGETLB`)
- CPU governor: unknown (AWS virtualized, cpufreq not exposed)
- THP: `madvise`
- Swappiness: default

Baseline benchmarks:
```
Xbar 1M rows:        45.20ms  [hugepages mmap FAILED]
EMA 1M rows:          2.15ms
Window JOIN 100K^2:  10.07ms
```

### Iteration 1: Claude Opus 4.6 Analysis — Hugepages Priority

Claude's extended thinking identified the root cause immediately:

> "The benchmark allocates 278 partitions with 32MB arenas each (~8.7GB), and every single mmap with MAP_HUGETLB fails, falling back to regular 4KB pages. This causes catastrophic TLB pressure — ~2.2M TLB entries vs ~4,448 with 2MB pages — a 512x difference."

**Commands applied:**
1. `echo 4608 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages` — allocate 9GB hugepages
2. `sysctl -w kernel.watchdog=0 kernel.nmi_watchdog=0` — disable watchdog timers
3. `sysctl -w vm.zone_reclaim_mode=0 vm.stat_interval=120 vm.dirty_ratio=80` — reduce VM stat overhead
4. `echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory` — compact memory
5. Disable all deep C-states (states 2-9) on all CPUs

CPU governor and CFS scheduler tuning **failed** — AWS virtualizes the CPU frequency controls (`cpufreq/scaling_governor` not present, `sched_min_granularity_ns` not exposed).

### Iteration 2: Further Kernel Tuning

Applied:
- `kernel.randomize_va_space=0` (later reverted — caused cache aliasing, +4ms on Xbar)
- `kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3`
- `kernel.timer_migration=0`
- `vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50 vm.min_free_kbytes=262144`

**Key finding:** Disabling ASLR (`randomize_va_space=0`) made Xbar **slower** by ~4ms due to L3 cache set aliasing from deterministic virtual addresses. Re-enabled.

## Manual Profiling Findings

### perf stat Results

```
cycles:         4,857,773,539
instructions:   1,506,218,500
IPC:            0.31          ← CRITICAL: extreme memory stall
sys time:       0.95s
user time:      0.32s
```

**IPC = 0.31 is the smoking gun.** Normal compute-bound code runs at IPC 2-4+. The 0.31 IPC means the CPU spends ~70% of cycles stalling on memory.

### Root Cause: Per-Row `std::vector` Allocation

Examining `exec_group_agg()` in `src/sql/executor.cpp`:

The **general GROUP BY path** (used by `GROUP BY XBAR(timestamp, bucket)`) calls `make_group_key()` per row:
```cpp
auto make_group_key = [&](const Partition& part, uint32_t idx)
    -> std::vector<int64_t>  // ← heap allocation per row!
```

For 1M rows, this causes **1M `std::vector<int64_t>` heap allocations** during query execution. Each allocation:
- Requires `malloc()` (fragmented heap traversal)
- Creates a pointer that cannot benefit from SIMD
- Thrashes TLB/cache with scattered heap addresses

This is an application-level optimization opportunity (future work: use a flat `int64_t` key for single-column xbar GROUP BY).

## Allocator Comparison

Testing with `LD_PRELOAD` on the Xbar benchmark:

| Allocator | Xbar 1M | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| glibc malloc | 53.2ms | Default |
| jemalloc | 51.6ms | +3% improvement |
| **tcmalloc_minimal** | **47.5ms** | **+12% improvement** |

tcmalloc's per-thread caches handle the pattern of 1M small short-lived allocations far better than glibc's arena approach.

---

## Compiler Optimization Stack

Tested systematically on top of hugepages + tcmalloc:

| Build | Xbar 1M | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| O3+march (baseline) | 53ms | Standard release build |
| O3+march+tcmalloc | 48ms | Allocator improvement |
| O3+march+PGO+tcmalloc | 47.3ms | PGO inline hints |
| **O3+march+LTO+PGO+tcmalloc** | **43.7ms** | **Best** |

GCC `-flto` enables cross-translation-unit inlining, particularly benefiting the `eval_where()` → `exec_group_agg()` call chains. ThinLTO (Clang) was attempted but blocked by LLVM version mismatch (Clang 19 vs LLD 15).

**PGO profile collection:**
```bash
cmake ... -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native -fprofile-generate=/tmp/apex_pgo2"
./apex_tests --gtest_filter="Benchmark.*:SqlExecutor*:FinancialFunction*:WindowJoin*"
cmake ... -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native -flto -fprofile-use=/tmp/apex_pgo2 -fprofile-correction"
```

## System Tuning Applied (Persistent)

Kernel parameters now active:
```
vm.nr_hugepages         = 4608   (9GB of 2MB pages)
vm.swappiness           = 1
vm.numa_balancing       = 0
vm.zone_reclaim_mode    = 0
vm.stat_interval        = 120
vm.dirty_ratio          = 80
vm.min_free_kbytes      = 262144
vm.vfs_cache_pressure   = 50
kernel.watchdog         = 0
kernel.nmi_watchdog     = 0
kernel.timer_migration  = 0
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2    (kept enabled — disabling hurts cache aliasing)
THP enabled             = never  (explicit hugepages preferred)
C-states 2-9            = disabled
```

---

## Build System Changes

Added two new CMake options to `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
option(APEX_USE_TCMALLOC  "Link tcmalloc_minimal for HFT allocation performance"  OFF)
option(APEX_USE_LTO       "Enable Link-Time Optimization (GCC -flto)"              OFF)
```

**Recommended HFT production build:**
```bash
cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native -flto -fprofile-use=/path/to/pgo -fprofile-correction" \
  -DAPEX_USE_TCMALLOC=ON \
  -DAPEX_USE_LTO=ON \
  -DAPEX_USE_PARQUET=OFF -DAPEX_USE_S3=OFF
```

Or quick build without PGO:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DAPEX_USE_TCMALLOC=ON -DAPEX_USE_LTO=ON \
         -DAPEX_USE_PARQUET=OFF -DAPEX_USE_S3=OFF
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hugepages must be pre-allocated** before the process starts. 0 hugepages = 512x more TLB entries for the 8.9GB working set. Single biggest win from OS tuning.

2. **ASLR re-enabling is important** for cache set distribution. Deterministic addresses cause aliasing in set-associative L3 caches.

3. **CPU governor is not accessible** on AWS EC2 instances (virtualized). CPU frequency is managed by the hypervisor.

4. **Allocator matters** more than kernel tuning for workloads with many small heap allocations. tcmalloc_minimal's thread-local caches gave 12% improvement vs glibc.

5. **LTO is surprisingly effective** (+8% on top of PGO+tcmalloc) for a codebase where the hot path spans multiple translation units (executor.cpp → storage/partition → arena).

6. **The real bottleneck** (application-level) is `make_group_key()` allocating `std::vector<int64_t>` per row for 1M rows. A future optimization: specialize single-column GROUP BY with `int64_t` key instead of `vector<int64_t>` — expected 2-5x reduction in xbar query time.

---

## Optimized Single-Column GROUP BY Path (Applied)

After the OS/compiler tuning session, the real bottleneck was identified as application-level:
`exec_group_agg` general path allocated `std::vector<int64_t>` per row as a GROUP BY key (1M allocations for 1M rows).

**Fix applied in `src/sql/executor.cpp`:**
- Added "Optimized path 2" for `gb.columns.size() == 1` (single-column GROUP BY)
- Uses `std::unordered_map<int64_t, std::vector<GroupState>>` — flat int64_t key, zero per-row heap allocs
- Hoisted aggregate column data pointers (`get_col_data()`) to partition scope — eliminates N×C per-row map lookups
- Handles XBAR bucketing, plain columns, symbol, and arith_expr GROUP BY

**Result with O3 + tcmalloc (no LTO/PGO):** 53ms → **13.34ms** (-75%)
**Result with LTO + PGO + tcmalloc:** **12.41ms** (-73% vs original 45.2ms)

## Parallel Path Optimization (exec_group_agg_parallel)

The same single-column optimization was applied to `exec_group_agg_parallel()`:
- Added `if (gb.columns.size() == 1)` early branch using `ScalarGroupMap = unordered_map<int64_t, vector<GroupState>>`
- Each parallel chunk works on a `PartialGroupScalar` with flat int64_t key
- Merge step folds partial scalar maps into the final result
- Multi-column parallel path unchanged for correctness

This ensures parallel GROUP BY queries also avoid per-row `vector<int64_t>` allocations.

The general path (`gb.columns.size() > 1`) is unchanged for multi-column GROUP BY correctness.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Collect PGO profile in production-like conditions (multiple query types)
- [ ] Try Clang 19 + ThinLTO once lld-19 is available (`sudo yum install lld19`)
- [ ] Evaluate 1GB hugepages for the 8.9GB arena working set (requires kernel cmdline `hugepagesz=1G`)
- [ ] Pin benchmark process to dedicated cores with `isolcpus` kernel parameter
