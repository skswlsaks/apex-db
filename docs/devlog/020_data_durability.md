# Devlog 020 — Data Durability: Intra-day Snapshot & Recovery

**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Status:** Complete
**Tests:** 605/605 pass (+2 new durability tests)

---

## Background

APEX-DB keeps all hot data in memory (RDB). Before this work:
- A process crash lost everything since the last EOD HDB flush.
- `FlushManager` only flushed SEALED partitions on memory pressure — ACTIVE partitions (current hour) had no disk representation at all.
- Restart required re-ingestion from the upstream feed, which is often impossible for historical intra-day data.

This gap was flagged as the highest product-readiness risk in BACKLOG.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. `HDBWriter::snapshot_partition()` — snapshot any partition regardless of state

```cpp
// include/apex/storage/hdb_writer.h
size_t snapshot_partition(const Partition& partition,
                          const std::string& snapshot_dir);
```

Writes all columns of a partition (ACTIVE or SEALED) to:
```
{snapshot_dir}/{symbol_id}/{hour_epoch}/{col}.bin
```

Uses existing `write_column_file()` — same LZ4-compressed binary format as regular HDB flush. Files are overwritten on each snapshot cycle (idempotent).

The key difference from `flush_partition()`: no sealed-state check. ACTIVE partitions are snapshotted as-is.

### 2. `FlushManager` — auto-snapshot timer + `snapshot_now()`

New `FlushConfig` fields:
```cpp
bool        enable_auto_snapshot = false;
uint32_t    snapshot_interval_ms = 60'000;  // 60s
std::string snapshot_path        = "";
```

`do_snapshot()` iterates all partitions via `pm_.get_all_partitions()` and calls `snapshot_partition()` for each non-empty one. Timer check added to `flush_loop()` — fires alongside the existing memory-pressure flush check.

`snapshot_now()` is a public synchronous trigger for tests and manual operations.

### 3. `ApexPipeline::start()` — recovery from snapshot on restart

New `PipelineConfig` fields:
```cpp
bool        enable_recovery         = false;
std::string recovery_snapshot_path  = "";
```

When `enable_recovery = true`, `start()` walks the snapshot directory with `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`, reads `timestamp`/`price`/`volume`/`msg_type` via `HDBReader`, and replays each row as a `TickMessage` via `store_tick()` before drain threads are started.

Recovery is single-threaded and happens synchronously — drain threads see a fully populated partition map when they start.

Works at all `StorageMode` levels (PURE_IN_MEMORY, TIERED, PURE_ON_DISK).

---

## Architecture

```
Normal operation:
  flush_loop() every 1s
    ├─ do_flush_sealed()     [existing: SEALED → HDB, on memory pressure]
    └─ if now - last_snap ≥ snapshot_interval_ms
           └─ do_snapshot()  [new: ALL partitions → snapshot_path]

Restart:
  ApexPipeline::start()
    ├─ [if enable_recovery] HDBReader(recovery_snapshot_path)
    │     └─ for each symbol/hour → read columns → store_tick() × N_rows
    ├─ flush_manager->start()
    └─ drain_threads.start()
```

## Tests

```
HDBTest.AutoSnapshot_CreatesFiles   PASSED  (6 ms)
HDBTest.Recovery_ReloadsData        PASSED  (6 ms)
```

**AutoSnapshot_CreatesFiles:**
1. Creates a TIERED pipeline with `enable_auto_snapshot=true`
2. Inserts 100 rows directly into an ACTIVE partition
3. Calls `flush_manager()->snapshot_now()`
4. Asserts `price.bin` exists under the snapshot dir

**Recovery_ReloadsData:**
1. Phase 1: Create pipeline, insert 50 rows, call `snapshot_now()`, destroy pipeline
2. Phase 2: Create a new `PURE_IN_MEMORY` pipeline with `enable_recovery=true`
3. Call `start()` — recovery runs before drain threads
4. Assert `total_stored_rows() == 50`

Total suite: **605/605** pass.

## Data Loss Window

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Process crash, ACTIVE partition | All intra-day data lost | ≤ `snapshot_interval_ms` (default 60 s) |
| Process crash, SEALED partition | Lost if not yet flushed | ≤ `snapshot_interval_ms` |
| EOD shutdown (graceful) | Preserved via HDB flush | Same (+ snapshot on stop) |

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reuse `write_column_file()`** — the only change needed in `HDBWriter` was removing the sealed-state precondition. All the directory creation, LZ4 compression, and file I/O was already correct.

2. **Recovery before drain threads** — placing recovery inside `start()` before the `emplace_back([this]{ drain_loop(); })` loop gives a clean single-threaded replay window. No locks needed.

3. **`std::filesystem` for directory enumeration** — straightforward, no need for a custom recursive scan. Already linked via C++20.

4. **Binary format for snapshots (not Parquet)** — avoids Arrow/Parquet dependencies in PURE_IN_MEMORY mode. Recovery path only needs `HDBReader`, which is already available in all storage modes.

## Next Steps

- `snapshot_now()` on graceful `stop()` — zero-loss shutdown (currently EOD only)
- Configurable retention: keep last N snapshots, prune older ones
- Snapshot compression stats in `FlushStats`
